#### SAX Information
Among transforming the exercise data sets into string representations using SAX,  
we then must convert these strings into appropriate bitmap representations.  
The plan is to convert **32 letters from the string into a 32 pixel bitmap image** and repeat  
this process until all bitmaps have been correctly generated.  
A 32 bitmap image will account for **12.5 seconds** in the data, such that we can have a  
total of **288 images**
