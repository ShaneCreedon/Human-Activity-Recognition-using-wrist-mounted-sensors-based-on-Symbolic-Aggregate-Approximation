#### SAX Information
Among transforming the exercise data sets into string representations using SAX,  
we then must convert these strings into appropriate bitmap representations.  
The plan is to convert **10 letters from the string into a 64 pixel bitmap image** and repeat  
this process until all bitmaps have been correctly generated. 
 
A 64 bitmap image will account for **25 seconds** in the data.  
In total for training and testing our model:

*Training image data set total:* **12,555**  
*Testing image data set total:* **3,145**
