                        SAX is the first symbolic representation for time series that allows for dimensionality reduction and
                        indexing with a lower-bounding distance measure. In classic data mining tasks such as clustering, 
                        classification, index, etc., SAX is as good as well-known representations such as Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
                        and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), while requiring less storage space. In addition, the representation allows
                        researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms in bioinformatics or text mining, and also
                        provides solutions to many challenges associated with current data mining tasks.

                        Symbolic Aggregate Approximation gives us the ability to generate a string representation of the time-series data. 
                        With this in hand, we can apply a form of bitmap generation on the string to achieve an image representation, which 
                        can then be subsequently fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) for testing or training. This bitmap requires
                        a series of parameters to adequately ensure that we can acquire a semi-decent accuracy with the model. For example:
                        a Grey-Scale image vs an RGB one, the size of these images, what is the frequency range between the colour spectrums?
                        Varying these parameters in addition to the parameters that SAX provides enables us to refine a model in different ways, 
                        in the hope of achieving a better accuracy.

                        In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. 
                        CNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Why are they useful for this project? A CNN convolves learned features with
                        input data and uses 2D convolutional layers. This means that this type of network is ideal for processing 2D images. Compared to other
                        image classification algorithms, CNNs actually use very little preprocessing. So, we can filter out previous generated bitmaps into our
                        CNN model to train it and learn the necessary motion artefacts that might be present. Once trained, we can then feed new image data into
                        the model for prediction.Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point 
                        for a model on a second task. Specifically, Google have a pre-trained model labeled: Inception V3.0, which has been trained on thousands of
                        images from the ImageNet database. We can use Googles model and then apply our data to only train the penultimate layer of the model. This technique
                        is relatively new in terms of machine learning but it is incredibly powerful, and most like has boosted our accuracy of prediction.

                        MQTT is an ISO standard publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections
                        with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern
                        requires a message broker. MQTT is an M2M (machine-to-machine), Internet of Things connectivity protocol. In relation to this particular project,
                        there is a client and server interaction using the MQTT protocol, with a mutual 'shared' broker machine, that facilitates communication. The server
                        does the majority of the processing while the client only does minimal, thus we can say it is a thin-client distributed architecture. The client will
                        often be required to convert their time-series into the activity string using SAX (described above) but that is all they are required to do. They then 
                        send just data to the server over the MQTT publish-subscribe architecture and the server is capable of receiving this, performing bitmap generation, feeding
                        the images generated into the previously trained model, and returning the prediction.
