##### Running project tests
1. To run my test suite, one must have all necessary requirements installed.  
This can be achieved using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Once the necessary requirements are installed, run: `python run_tests.py` in the src/ directory to begin.
- There are over 70 test cases written so execution may take several (2-3) minutes.
