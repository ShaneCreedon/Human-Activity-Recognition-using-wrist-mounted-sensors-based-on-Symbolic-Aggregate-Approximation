# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensor technology based on Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) and Machine Vision.

### Student: Shane Creedon
#### Student ID: 15337356
#### Year Of Study: 4th Year

#### What is the purpose of the project?
The aim of this project is to build an application capable of detecting human activity. We hope to be able to recognise  
four cardinal activities come the project-end.  
These include:  
1. Walking
2. Running
3. Slow Cycle
4. Fast Cycle 

#### Why is such a project useful?
A project like this has many uses in the real world. For example, elderly healthcare activity tracking or even in the  
case of diabetics. Diabetics need regular exercise due to having too much glucose in their blood. 
Primarily because their body doesn't produce enough insulin to process it. Exercise can reduce the glucose levels in  
your blood. As a result, monitoring activity of diabetics can be extremely important.  

Another application of the project could be within the fitness industry. Specifically, the app could be used to monitor 
what type of activity people are doing within a gym environment. Personal trainers could use the application to 
track their clients on a regular basis.

#### How is the project going to be implemented
