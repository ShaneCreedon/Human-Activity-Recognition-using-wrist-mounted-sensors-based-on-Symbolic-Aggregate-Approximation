## Blog Post #1 | Proposal Submission and Upcoming Goals | 04/11/2018

The basis for the project is recognising human activity using wearable sensor technology based on 
Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) and Machine Vision.

After discussing the idea with Tomas in great detail, we both agreed to work together on this project as part of my 4th year project.
With the idea in mind, I constructed the proposal documented due for both Tomas and my presentation supervisors.
The proposal specified all the nitty-gritty details of the project and I hope gave clear insight into what we are trying to achieve.

I sent the document to Tomas for review and discussion the idea with the project presentation supervisors (Darragh & Mark)
who all thankfully approved the idea and allowed me to move forward.

My next primary goal is to set up Continuous Integration (CI) practices for my projects GitLab either using the GitLab
built-in CI tools or use something like Jenkins / Teamcity.

Week 9 requires the completion of my functional specification which needs to be ~25 pages in length describing the project
in great detail using both easy to understand language and UML diagrams depicting the technical structure.   

Currently it is week 7, I will aim to get these above two steps complete within the next week.
