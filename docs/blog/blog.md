## Blog Post #1 | Proposal Submission and Upcoming Goals | 04/11/2018

The basis for the project is recognising human activity using wearable sensor technology based on 
Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) and Machine Vision.

After discussing the idea with Tomas in great detail, we both agreed to work together on this project as part of my 4th year project.
With the idea in mind, I constructed the proposal documented due for both Tomas and my presentation supervisors.
The proposal specified all the nitty-gritty details of the project and I hope gave clear insight into what we are trying to achieve.

I sent the document to Tomas for review and discussion the idea with the project presentation supervisors (Darragh & Mark)
who all thankfully approved the idea and allowed me to move forward.

My next primary goal is to set up Continuous Integration (CI) practices for my projects GitLab either using the GitLab
built-in CI tools or use something like Jenkins / Teamcity.

Week 9 requires the completion of my functional specification which needs to be ~25 pages in length describing the project
in great detail using both easy to understand language and UML diagrams depicting the technical structure.   

Currently it is week 7, I will aim to get these above two steps complete within the next week.

## Blog Post #2 | Development of the functional specification | 1/12/2018

Like most students, I have began working on my Function Specification discussing my project
idea in great detail. Within the specification, I discuss:
- An introduction section, where I overview the project and why we are building it.

- Section two provides a *General Description* of the product/system functions.
  It is in this section I detail a high-level abstract look at the individual functions our application will perform.
  I try my best to be as thorough as possible through the document while offering visualisations of the functionality for
  a stronger conceptual understanding.
  This section also discusses the many constraints my system will face throughout its development.

-  Section three will discuss all of the functions of the system in great, great detail.
   Each function will have a description, criticality overview, technical issues faced, 
   dependencies on other requirements and other details that many offer insight into the function.

- Section 4 looks at the system architecture and how the overall system will piece together.
  I offer visualisations here constructed on behalf of showing how system components tie with one another.

- Section 5 looks at the high-level design / abstract view of the system. 
  Within the section displayed are 3 Data-Flow Diagrams showing how data moves around individual components.
  There is also a minimalistic conceptual class diagram of how the application classes will interact.
  Finally, there is a use case diagram showing how a particular user may interact with the system.

- Section 6 shows the schedule of project activities over the course of the project timeline.
  I showcase a Gantt Chart diagram to display this information.

- Section 7 is a list of references I made use of when developing the project idea.
