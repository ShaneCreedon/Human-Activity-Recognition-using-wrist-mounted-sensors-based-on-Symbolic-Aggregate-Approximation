Human activity recognition, or HAR, is a challenging time series classification task.
It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data. Generally, 
inertial sensors and cameras have provided the foundation for HAR studies. This project 
aims to simplify this wearable approach further by determining if wrist-mounted optical 
sensing, usually used for heart rate determination, can also provide useful data for relevant activity recognition.

Based on Python, the project consists of a web application written in Django and a 
desktop application built using PyQt5. TensorFlow and Keras have been used to construct the 
Machine Learning backend with an emphasis on Transfer Learning. MQTT has been involved 
to allow for asynchronous communication between the client and server.
